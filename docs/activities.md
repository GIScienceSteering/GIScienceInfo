## Activities
### Bids for GIScience 2025 
We are delighted to invite bids to host the next GIScience conference. You can find a list of questions that you should consider in preparing your bid [here](GIScience_Bids_Questions.pdf). You should prepare and submit your bid to the chairs of the steering committee (Ross Purves and Renee Sieber) by January 31st 2024. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

### Early career members of the steering committee
We are looking for early career members of the steering committee. If you enjoyed GIScience, think you might attend the conference again in 2025, and either don't yet have a PhD, or completed your PhD less than 5 years ago, we'd love to hear from you. 

To apply, send a 1 page letter explaining why you'd like to be part of the GIScience Steering Committee, what you see as the strengths and weaknesses of the conference, and one change you would make, to Renee Sieber and Ross Purves by November 30th, 2024.
